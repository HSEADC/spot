Since then, we have focused our attention to improving the appearance of the Old South Baton Rouge Community. Now with over 80 murals under our belt, MOPA is one of the leading mural producers in the southern part of the United States. “ We love to work with artists who are able to integrate their work into the community.” Yes, our work is often considered art for arts sake, but we try to incorporate the culture of the community into the art so that the people in Old South Baton Rouge can be proud of where they live and celebrate its rich history.</p></body></html>
